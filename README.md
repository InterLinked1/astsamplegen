**Generate Asterisk sample configs from the Asterisk XML documentation**

`astsamplegen` generates Asterisk sample config files directly from the XML documentation in Asterisk.

This is primarily useful for generating sample config files for modules which have XML documentation already but no sample config.
Note that the sample config is generated heuristically, and may need some tweaking and fine-tuning before being usable.

## Limitations

The quality of the sample config generated by this tool depends greatly on the quality of the XML documentation.
For example, config options with enums in the documentation will result in highly relevant sample values in
the generated config. For sparser documentation, it is more difficult and the generated config may be more generic.

As the documentation improves and this tool is updated to handle edge cases better, the quality should improve even further. Contributions to handle configs that could have been generated better based on the existing documentation are welcome.
